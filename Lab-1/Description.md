# CS F303 – Computer Networks Lab 1 Summary

**Lab 1 Topic:** Packet Sniffing using Wireshark & Traceroute  

## Description  
This lab focused on understanding how data travels over a network by *observing real network traffic*. Using **Wireshark**, students captured packets generated by web browsing and studied how different network protocols work together. Using **Traceroute**, students learned how packets move through multiple routers to reach a destination.

## Key Terms (Simple Explanation)  
- **Packet Sniffing:** Monitoring and capturing network packets sent or received by a computer.  
- **Wireshark:** A packet analyzer that displays detailed information about captured packets.  
- **Packet:** A small unit of data sent over a network.  
- **Protocol:** A set of rules that define how data is transmitted (e.g., HTTP, TCP, IP).  
- **HTTP:** Protocol used for communication between a web browser and web server.  
- **TCP:** Transport protocol that ensures reliable data transfer.  
- **IP Address:** Unique identifier of a device on a network.  
- **Port Number:** Identifies a specific application or service running on a device.  
- **TTL (Time To Live):** Limits how many routers a packet can pass through.  
- **Traceroute:** Tool used to find the path taken by packets from source to destination.  
- **ICMP:** Protocol used for error reporting and network diagnostics.

## Solutions / Observations  
- Captured HTTP GET and response packets and analyzed headers, ports, and IP addresses.
- Observed persistent and non-persistent HTTP connections.
- Identified multiple HTTP requests for embedded webpage objects.
- Measured response time between HTTP request and server reply.
- Used Traceroute to identify intermediate routers and calculate per-hop delay using round-trip times.

## Assessment Note  
The **Lab Test on Nalanda portal** consisted of **4 questions**, testing understanding of Wireshark packet analysis and Traceroute output interpretation.
